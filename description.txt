This mod takes inspiration for the Attribute Anomaly mechanic from Zenless Zone Zero!

Stacking debuffs (Example: Frostburn, On Fire!, and Cursed Inferno) of the same type will inflict Anomaly Buildup! Once you reach a certain level of anomaly buildup, the enemy will be afflicted with an Attribute Anomaly!

If you inflict Attribute Anomaly while having anomaly buildup of other debuffs, you will cause Disorder which will deal bonus damage!

Now it's a lot more favorable to use weapons that stack debuffs quickly, like flamethrowers, and applying two debuffs lets you apply massive bursts of Disorder damage!

Usually applying damaging debuffs to bosses don't feel impactful at all, but this mod can make those useless debuffs turn overpowered with the help of Attribute Anomaly!

Made for the first official tmodloader jam!
